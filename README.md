# Data Analysis and Visualization Projects

## Project Overview

This repository contains various data analysis and visualization projects using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. Our goal is to explore different datasets, perform data cleaning and analysis, and visualize the findings.


## Technologies Used

- Python: Main programming language.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.


## Projects

- Pandas Basics: Introduction to data manipulation using Pandas, focusing on data loading, cleaning, and basic analysis operations.
- NumPy Arrays: Demonstrates how to perform mathematical operations with NumPy arrays.
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib: Creating various chart types (line, bar, scatter plots) to visualize data trends.
